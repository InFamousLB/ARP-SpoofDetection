# ARP-SpoofDetection
This scripts purpose is to quickly be able to detect if any MAC address is being spoofed on your host system's arp table. 
Basically it reads through all the MAC addresses in the arp table for any duplicates and spits out a result either identifying the spoofed address
or outputting that no MAC duplicates were detected.

I built this script in order to practice Python fundamentals, along with wanting to be able to detect any Man-in-the-Middle attacks, or MAC spoofing,
should the need ever arise.
I'm by no means a 'master' of python or its implementation into cybersecurity, but i'm hopeful to learn more and likely improve this script and any
other tools I upload to github. 
I hope any who decide to download this program find it useful, and thanks for checking it out :)
